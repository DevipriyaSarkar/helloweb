* Encryption
* Decryption 
* Hacking
## Materials
* papers 
* pens 
* code language
## Preparation
A code language is prepared and students are separated into groups 
## Introduction
Welcome your participants and explain them that in this activity we are going to learn the working of  encryption,decryption and hacking.
The activity is as follows:
* A student is asked to write a message.
* The message is passed to his friend who codes it according to the code language
* The message coding is the process of encryption in which the data transmission is kept safer even if the data package is being captured
* The message is passed across the class like the data package passing through the class obviously none will be able to decode the message
* Once it reaches the final recipient he decodes it and this process is decryption.
* Now the code language is let out and when the message is passed out 
* Once when the message is caught by the fellow student they decode it and the message is revealed
* Similarly,when the user sends information to the cloud it is possible to caputure the data using the process of phishing or brute force and can perform hacking
* Generally,hacking refers to the practice of modifying or altering computer software and hardware to accomplish a goal that is considered to be outside of the creator's original objective. Those individuals who engage in computer hacking activities are typically referred to as hackers.
