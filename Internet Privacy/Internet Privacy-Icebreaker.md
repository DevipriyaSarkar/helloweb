Offline Activity Steps:
All the participants are made to stand in a circle and asked to keep one of their footwear in the centre of the circle
Now cover all the foot-wears with a cloth, start the timer for 10 sec and ask the participants to rush towards the centre and collect one footwear without peeking under the cloth
Everyone is supposed to have one footwear with them and the person whom it belongs to will be their partners for the session
A sheet of paper consisting of basic questions about a person is handed out to each participant and are asked to fill in with answers from their partners.
With this basic information from a stranger the participant has to form 3 good and 3 bad passwords for their partner respectively.
Place the post-its in two sections on the wall namely, good and bad and analyze the methods to create a secure, strong password.

Good passwords are critical to information security. Lack of thought in creating password policies increases the chances of unauthorized access or compromised data. The strong password policy include the following characteristics:


Contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation, numbers, and symbols.
Contain at least 15 characters.
Be unique from other accounts owned by the user.
Never include dictionary words
Never include patterns of characters
Go even further in your password policy by encouraging the use of passphrases, which use phrases along with the strong password guidelines to add even further difficulty to passwords being compromised.


The full negative effect of a compromised account sometimes can take months or years to be felt. With the nature of information we deal with online each day, thereâ€™s no room to be relaxed about our approach to account security. Keeping users, systems, and resources secure today requires a combined efforts using strong password policies and staying on top of the latest information security best practices.
