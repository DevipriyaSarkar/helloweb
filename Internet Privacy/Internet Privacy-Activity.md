Introduction:
Internet privacy is primarily concerned with data protection.
Anytime you view a web site, information is sent from your computer to the web server and from the web server to your computer.  The transmission of this information is normally sent in "plain text", meaning anyone would be able to read it should they see it.  Now consider this, each piece of information transmitted traverses many computers (servers) to reach its destination.

Steps
1) On your computer, click Start, then Run

2) Type "cmd" and click "OK" (or press Enter)

3) Type this in exactly:  tracert www.ssl.com

4) Press Enter

Each listing in the window is a different computer/router/switch (a "node" in networking terms).  Each "node" represents a point at which any data you send might be recorded!  It is not uncommon to see 20-30 listings.


Big deal, right?  Consider this the next time you type in a password or your credit card number on any web page without checking if itâ€™s secure or not.

1)Ask the participants to write one point on a post-it that would help in differentiating between a secure and not-so-secure/fake webpage.


2)Paste all the post-its and analyze all the points and discuss the concepts behind it.

3)Few of the concepts could include technical terms which could be understood with the help of a next level(Intermediate) activity.



How can you tell if a web page is secured?

There are two general indications of a secured web page:
1) Check the web page URL
Normally, when browsing the web, the URLs (web page addresses) begin with the letters "http".  However, over a secure connection the address displayed should begin with "https" - note the "s" at the end.



2) Check for the "Lock" icon
There is a standard among web browsers to display a "lock" icon somewhere in the window of the browser. For example, Microsoft Internet Explorer displays the lock icon in the lower-right of the browser window:




THE LOCK ICON IS NOT JUST A PICTURE!  Click on it to see details of the site's security.  Other Indicators of a Secured Web Page

 Common characteristics of these site seals include:
High Visibility - Online merchants want you to see these site seals.  They want you to know they have made every effort to make their site a safe shopping experience.  Therefore, the site seal is usually located where you, the customer, can easily see it.
Difficult to Duplicate - The site seals are designed to be difficult for thieves and scammers to duplicate.  Many times the site seal will have a date and time stamp on it.
Verification Functionality - The site seal should have some functionality whether by clicking on the seal or by hovering your mouse over the seal.  The functionality should display detailed information about the web site you are visiting.

If everything looks good, the company or individual(s) running that website have provided you with a safe means of communicating your sensitive information.  The web page is "secure".
