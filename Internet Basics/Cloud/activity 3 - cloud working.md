Cloud computing takes the emphasis away from local computers. It is less about the machine we use at home or on the move and more about what is happening on computers many miles away. Instead of having to store information on our PC, smartphone or tablet, our data can be kept remotely. It will then be made available to any device that can read it. Typically, mostly cloud computing is connected via a internet but there are other ways, including specially-made apps for computers, tablets and smartphones. These act as access points for cloud services. They also mean that we donâ€™t always need to have dedicated software installed on our machines. The benefit of this is clear- suddenly we are not tied to our own computer. We do not even need to be tied to our own phone. All we need is a way of accessing the data and that be done from any machine. As we can see, this differs from traditional computing because we do not need portable storage media nor are we relying on how fast our system is. With cloud computing, we are seeing programs and data being managed and provided as a service over the internet and it opens many possibilities.
