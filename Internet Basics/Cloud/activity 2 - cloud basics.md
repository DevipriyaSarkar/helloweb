The term “Cloud” came from a network design that was used by network engineers to represent the location of various network devices and their inter-connection.  The shape of this network design was like a cloud. Cloud computing is the practice of using network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or personal computer.
Cloud computing decreases the hardware and software demand from the user’s side.

While accessing service like email our data is stored on cloud server and not on our computer. The technology and infrastructure behind the cloud is invisible. An individual user can connect to cloud system from his/her own devices like desktop, laptop or mobile.

Cloud computing gives small businesses access to the technologies that previously were out of their reach.

In an in-house IT server, you have to pay a lot of attention and ensure that there are no flaws into the system so that it runs smoothly. And in case of any technical glitch you are completely responsible.
